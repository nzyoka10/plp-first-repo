**Introduction to HTML** 
- What is HTML? 
    - HyperText Markup Language. It's a standard markup language for creating 
- It enables one to create interactive web pages, structure content, and effectively communicate your message.

## The Crucial Role of HTML in Web Development

HTML plays an essential role in web development as it defines the structure and content of web pages. It serves as the backbone upon which websites are built. HTML accomplishes this by utilizing a system of tags and elements, each serving a unique purpose.

## How Do I Write HTML Code?

Writing HTML code is a matter of understanding HTML tags. Tags are enclosed within angle brackets, each comprising an opening and closing part. They function as building blocks that define the structure of your web page. Think of them as the bricks and mortar of web development. Understanding their roles is essential for web development.

## How to Create a Website Using HTML?

Creating a website using HTML involves several key steps. Let's go over them in the following sections.

### Website Planning

Before you start coding, take time to plan your website thoroughly. Identify your target audience, outline the content and structure of your site, and design a layout that aligns with your goals. Keep in mind that the visual design can be enhanced with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a topic we'll explore later in your web development journey.

### Writing HTML Code

Open a text editor, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, and begin writing HTML code. Start with the basic structure, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html></html>`, `<head></head>`, and `<body></body>`. Then, populate the body with your content.

### Saving as .html

Save your HTML files with a `.html` extension to indicate that they are web pages. Proper file naming is essential for organizing your project.

### Local Testing

To see how your website looks and functions, open your HTML files in a web browser. This local testing phase allows you to fine-tune your design and layout.

### Hosting and Publishing

For your website to be accessible on the internet, you'll need web hosting services. Various providers offer hosting, and you'll typically obtain a domain name (for example, www.yourwebsite.com) to point to your hosted site.

## How to Start HTML Code

Starting HTML code is straightforward. Let's go over each step in the following sections.

### Text Editor Selection

Choose a text editor that suits your needs. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. These editors offer features like syntax highlighting and autocompletion tailored to web development.

### HTML 5 Declaration

Initiate your HTML document with `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This declaration signifies the use of HTML5, the latest HTML standard.

### Building the Structure

Inside the `<html></html>` tags, create your HTML structure. The `<head></head>` section contains metadata, including the page title, and the `<body></body>` section houses the visible content of your web page.

### Adding Metadata

Within the `<head></head>` section, utilize the `<meta>` tag to specify the character encoding, ensuring proper rendering.

## How Do I Run HTML Code Step by Step

Executing HTML code is straightforward, thanks to modern web browsers. Here's a step-by-step guide.

### Save Your HTML File

Ensure that your HTML file is saved with a `.html` extension. This signals to your computer that it's an HTML document.

### Double-Click to Open

Double-click the HTML file, and your default web browser will automatically open it. Your browser renders the HTML, displaying your web page.

### Alternative Browsers

If you prefer a specific web browser, you can right-click the HTML file and choose "Open with" to select your preferred browser.

### Inspect and Debug

Modern web browsers come equipped with built-in developer tools that enable you to inspect and debug your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Access these tools by right-clicking on your web page and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac).

## How Do You Write "Hello" in HTML?

Displaying "Hello" on a web page is straightforward. You can use the `<h1>` tag to create a top-level heading, as demonstrated earlier. HTML offers multiple ways to present "Hello." For instance:

```html
<h1>Hello!</h1>
