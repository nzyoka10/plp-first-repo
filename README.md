- It serves as the backbone upon which websites are built.
-  HTML accomplishes this by utilizing a system of tags and elements, each serving a unique purpose.

#### How Do I Write HTML Code?

#### How to Create a Website Using HTML?

- Creating a website using HTML involves several key steps. Let's go over them in the following sections.

#### Website Planning

- Before start coding the site, take time to plan the website thoroughly. 
- Identify your target audience, outline the content and structure of your site, and design a layout that aligns with your goals. 
- Keep in mind that the visual design can be enhanced with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), a topic we'll explore later in your web development journey.

### Writing HTML Code

    Open a text editor, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, and begin writing HTML code. Start with the basic structure, including 
    `<!DOCTYPE html>`, 
    `<html></html>`, 
    `<head></head>`, 
        and 
    `<body></body>`. 
    Then, add the body with your content.

#### Saving as .html

- Save your HTML files with a `.html` extension to indicate that they are web pages. 
- Proper file naming is essential for organizing your project.

#### Local Testing

- To see how your website looks and functions, open your HTML files in a web browser. 
- This local testing phase allows you to fine-tune your design and layout.

#### Hosting and Publishing

- For your website to be accessible on the internet, you'll need web hosting services. 
- Various providers offer hosting, and you'll typically obtain a domain name (for example, ***www.yourwebsite.com*** ) to point to your hosted site.

#### How to Start HTML Code

#### Text Editor Selection

- Choose a text editor that suits your needs. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. 
- These editors offer features like syntax highlighting and autocompletion tailored to web development.


### Building the Structure

- Inside the `<html></html>` tags, create your HTML structure. 
- The `<head></head>` section contains metadata, including the page title, and the `<body></body>` section houses the visible content of your web page.

#### Adding Metadata

- Within the `<head></head>` section, utilize the `<meta>` tag to specify the character encoding, ensuring proper rendering.



#### -> Save Your HTML File

#### -> Inspect and Debug

- Modern web browsers come equipped with built-in developer tools that enable you to inspect and debug your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- Access these tools by right-clicking on your web page and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac).
